## OBJECTIVE
*My web-CV* is a web-app that precents my skills to the potential employer. The template can be used by everyone. The web-app uses **React.js (18.2)**, **React Router (6.4)**, **Bootstrap for React.js**, **MUI Material Icons** and some other libraries for React.js and CSS, also there is the basic **TomTom map API** integration.

## BACKGROUND
The main Components that are used:
- React Router 
- Router Offcanvas Navigation ('Menu' Component)
- OverLay Trigger and Popover ('Skills' Component)
- Vertical Timeline ('TimeLine' Component)
- MUI Material Icons
- TomTom map API ('map' Component)

CSS and React libraties are used:
- Bootstrap for React
- React Waves
- Animate CSS    


## TECHNICAL DESIGN

*My web-CV* uses CSS libraries to short work time in CSS.
The **Offcanvas** navigation saves space and gives the resposive look in the mobile versions.
The Home page is quite simple - there is short presentation, the **Popopver Button** saves space to present the skills. **MUI Material Icons** is used also. Also the **React Wave Components** is used to create the non-static element.
The Education and Work Expierence page includes **Vertical Timeline Component**.
The Portfolio Page uses the **Bootstrap Layout Components**. Also the **MUI Material Icons** and **Bootsrap Modals** are used.
The Contact page uses **Bootstrap Layout Components**, **MUI Material Icons** and the **TomTom map API Component**. 
The **TomTom Component** is very simple as the main goal was to show the location and there was no need in any in interective map, but interective map is better than just a static picture.

CAVEATS

There is possibility to create more animated elements to do the web-app less static.
